# Inbox Actions
Inbox Actions adds convenient interactions to your messages by detecting structured data (Microdata and JSON-LD) embedded in emails. It automatically surfaces actionable items directly in Thunderbirdâ€™s interface, allowing you to  interact with services or perform tasks without even opening the email.

 ## Roadmap
 Pull requests that build towards these objectives are greatly appricated! All roadmap items should work for both json-ld and microdata
